  abstract  = {This chapter expresses that cyber‐attacks have continued since 1988, with effects that range from data collection to controlling critical infrastructure. It provides a mix of documented cyber incidents, with only the Morris Worm in question, as to malevolent intent. Cyber risk assessment is a growing area of interest, and an inspiration for developing cyber modeling and simulation techniques. In addition to profile of commercial cyber activity, military applications are expanding as well, with notable uses in Estonia and Georgia over the last decade. The chapter also provides a template to examine the policy, training, and technology options of a cyber‐attacked state. Cyber's overarching use has implications across both a country's business systems and its supporting civil infrastructure. Real‐world cyber scenarios then use the assessments of the business systems, as baselines, to represent both the scope and scale of networks with technologies and configurations that can easily span multiple generations of information technology.},

Because of the high cost of physical hardware, these tests are always performed in a virtual environment. Kathará is a network emulation system which accurately reproduces the behaviour of a real system. It can exploit several virtualization technologies leveraging on its modularity. Lately, Kathará has been rewritten to overcome some implementation limitations and performance issues. This paper presents the Kathará model and its new architecture, demonstrating its value, comparing its scalability and performance with Netkit (another state-of-the-art tool for network emulation) and with the previous version of Kathará.},

  abstract        = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) are deeply changing the networking field by introducing software at any level, aiming at decoupling the logic from the hardware. Together, they bring several benefits, mostly in terms of scalability and flexibility. Up to now, SDN has been used to support NFV from the routing and the architectural point of view. In this paper we present Kathará, a framework based on containers, that allows network operators to deploy Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) through the adoption of emerging data-plane programmable capabilities, such as P4-compliant switches. It also supports the coexistence of SDN and traditional routing protocols in order to set up arbitrarily complex networks. As a side effect, thanks to Kathará, we demonstrate that implementing NFV by means of specific-purpose equipment is feasible and it provides a gain in performance while preserving the benefits of NFV. We measure the resource consumption of Kathará and we show that it performs better than frameworks that implement virtual networks using virtual machines by several orders of magnitude.},

Results show that the simulation environment has a remarkable effect on the required time for building a topology, for instance, the powerful resources scenario needed only 0.19 sec, whereas, 5.611 sec were needed when the resources were less. However, the required time were increased in both scenarios when the number of nodes was increased into 242.842 and 3718.117 sec for the powerful and less capabilities resources respectively.},

Modelling DoS/DDoS attacks is necessary to get a better understanding of their behaviour at each step of the attack process, from the Botnet recruitment up to the dynamics of the attack. A deeper understanding of DoS/DDoS attacks would lead to the development of more efficient solutions and countermeasures to mitigate their impact. In this survey, we present a classification approach for existing DoS/DDoS models in different kinds of networks; traditional networks, Software Defined Networks (SDN) and virtual networks. In addition, this article provides a thorough review and comparison of the existing attack models, in particular we explain, analyze and simulate different aspects of three prominent models; congestion window, queuing, and epidemic models (same model used for corona virus spread analysis). Furthermore, we quantify the damage of DoS/DDoS attacks at three different levels; protocol (Transmission Control Protocol-TCP), device’s resources (bandwidth, CPU, memory), and network (infection and recovery speed).},

Integrating Kathar{\'a} into the Computer Networking through a set of proper exercises with different objectives can significantly enhance the teaching and learning performance. Such a kind of work must tackle three main challenges: the diversity of protocols, simplicity of the exercises, and scalability of the networks. Our solution leverages the features of Kathar{\'a} to make hands-on lab exercises more accessible, reproducible, and customizable for the students instead of asking for a strong background in network programming. Our observation during the teaching process concludes that this hands-on lab facilitates the learning of students from different schools, such as information technology, education, and engineering.},
